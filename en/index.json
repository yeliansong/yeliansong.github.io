5：TCP 的流量控制机制 主要是下面的四种机制： 慢启动（慢开始）： 慢开始不是指 cwnd 的增长速度慢（指数增长），而是指 TCP 开始发送设置 cwnd=1。 思路：不要一开始就发送大量的数据，先探测一下网络的拥塞程度，也就是说由小到大 逐渐增加拥塞窗口的大小。这里用报文段的个数的拥塞窗口大小举例说明慢开始算法，实时 拥塞窗口大小是以字节为单位的。 为了防止 cwnd 增长过大引起网络拥塞，设置一个慢开始门限（ssthresh 状态变量） 当 cnwd＜ssthresh，使用慢开始算法 当 cnwd=ssthresh，既可使用慢开始算法，也可以使用拥塞避免算法 当 cnwd＞ssthresh，使用拥塞避免算法 拥塞避免： 拥塞避免并非完全能够避免拥塞，是说在拥塞避免阶段将拥塞窗口控制为按线性规律增 长，使网络比较不容易出现拥塞。 思路：让拥塞窗口 cwnd 缓慢地增大，即每经过一个往返时间 RTT就把发送方的拥塞控 制窗口加一。 无论是在慢开始阶段还是在拥塞避免阶段，只要发送方判断网络出现拥塞（其根据就是没有 收到确认，虽然没有收到确认可能是其他原因的分组丢失，但是因为无法判定，所以都当做 拥塞来处理），就把慢开始门限设置为出现拥塞时的发送窗口大小的一半。然后把拥塞窗口 设置为 1，执行慢开始算法。 如图所示： 快速重传： 快重传要求接收方在收到一个失序的报文段后就立即发出重复确认（为的是使发送方及 早知道有报文段没有到达对方）而不要等到自己发送数据时捎带确认。快重传算法规定，发 送方只要一连收到三个重复确认就应当立即重传对方尚未收到的报文段，而不必继续等待设 置的重传计时器时间到期。 由于不需要等待设置的重传计时器到期，能尽早重传未被确认的报文段，能提高整个网 络的吞吐量。 快速恢复： 当发送方连续收到三个重复确认时，就执行“乘法减小”算法，把 ssthresh 门限减半。 但是接下去并不执行慢开始算法。 考虑到如果网络出现拥塞的话就不会收到好几个重复的确认，所以发送方现在认为网络 可能没有出现拥塞。所以此时不执行慢开始算法，而是将 cwnd 设置为 ssthresh 的大小， 然后执行拥塞避免算法。 ","date":"2023-08-17

他现在已经克服了刚进学校时的那种拘谨，无论和熟人还是和生人交往，都基本上不存在什么心理障碍了。加上他演过戏，又去黄原讲过故事，见了世面，这半年不光担任劳动干事，还被选成班上管宣传的团支部委员，因而显得比一般同学都要活跃一些。班上的同学都开始对他尊重起来，尤其是一些女同学，也开始用一种异样的眼光来看他了——就好像他是刚出现的一个新人。 但是郝红梅对

What you need to remember is that you can think of using the lsof command when it comes to files. List some simple application scenarios to deepen the use of commands. 3.1 Check which processes have opened a file This should be used frequently. In windows, for example, if you want to close a certain file, you can’t close it. The reason is that this file is used by many processes at the same time. If you want to close it, you can’t close it. You can only close it first. All the processes that are using the file should be killed. At this time, lsof can be used. +d is an operation for folders, and if you need to kill all process ids, you can use awk to list the pid numbers and then kill them. 3.2 View all files opened by a process This sometimes needs to be used, what operations a certain process has done, and which files have been opened. Use lsof -p + pid to see which files the process has open. 3.3 View files opened by ipv4 and ipv6 Network-related file operations are also used a lot, so to locate some problems, you need to use lsof to view some network-related operations on files. lsof -i is to view the operations of ipv4 and v6 on files. Of course, if you need to see ipv4 or ipv6 separately, you can directly specify lsof -i ipv4/ipv6 $ sudo lsof -i 4 $ sudo lsof -i 6 3.4 List the files related to the port This is used a lot, and you often need to check the files used by the relevant ports, such as port 22 or something. Use lsof -i:port.

Although it is a long science fiction novel, But the whole storyline is conceived on the basis of reality, and the plot is not completely divorced from reality. The shaping of the characters and the analysis of human nature make the whole book not look like just a science fiction book.

The plot can be simply summarized as a story of the struggle between the earth civilization and the three-body civilization in outer space and the ultimate destruction of the universe, which is interspersed with the red shore base broadcasting information to outer space, the three-body man's reply, and the three-body man's fleet to capture the earth , the Wallfacer Project in the Era of Crisis, the dimensionality reduction strike of water droplets on space battleships, the law of the dark forest of logic, the Swordbearer Project, the exposure of the coordinates of the Trisolaran civilization, the Earth Bunker Project, the destruction of the solar system, and the earth civilization that escaped from the solar system continue. The whole storyline is done in one go, and it is enjoyable to watch. Here I have to mention the inhuman imagination of Mr. Liu Cixin. When Mr. Liu Cixin created “Three-Body Problem”, he was working as a computer engineer in a power plant in Yangquan City, Shanxi. It is hard to imagine that in such a small city, the staff of a power plant can have such The imagination of the vast universe, some jokes on the Internet say that Liu is the originator of Moyu, hahaha, it is true, creating such an excellent work during work is indeed the ultimate in Moyu, Liu’s “Three-Body” It also created a precedent for Chinese science fiction works, giving Chinese science fiction a place on the world stage. There is a short story that Obama, then President of the United States, felt unsatisfied after watching the first two parts of “The Three-Body Problem”, and urged Liu to release the third part as soon as possible.

These are very laborious and costly. Is it not good to use this money to build a well-off society? After all, there are still many places that have not yet escaped poverty, or to build and protect our own living environment-is the earth bad? Readers can also give themselves a minute to think about it here. Let’s talk about some things about humans and Mars first. The 9 major planets in the solar system (after removing Pluto in 2006, the 8 major planets) Mars is the closest planet to the earth. Human beings have always been very interested in this neighbor. As early as the 1960s, they began to observe Mars with telescopes. In 1971, the Soviet Union Mars The No. 3 lander successfully landed on Mars and became the first probe to reach Mars. Then the American lander also landed on Mars. On May 15, 2021, China’s Zhu Rong also successfully landed on Mars. Of course, the research on Mars is also clear. The size of Mars is 1/6 of the Earth, and the weight is 1/10 of the Earth. The surface environment is the closest to the Earth among the 9 planets. Like the Earth, it has four seasons. The temperature It is also very close to the earth, and it is also observed that large-scale sandstorms often occur on the surface of Mars, indicating that there is a flow of air, mainly carbon dioxide. These detection results are of great significance to human beings, including the human migration plan to Mars, Mars mining, etc. There are infinite possibilities. Compared with the money and manpower invested, the return value is really infinite. See, I gave this example to answer the question I asked before. Of course, this is just Mars. Think deeper, look at the entire Milky Way and the entire universe, what if there are other alien civilizations, and the evolution of other civilizations is much higher than ours? explain.

A few years later, he received a reply from the Three-Body Civilization: Don’t answer! Don’t answer! Don’t answer! At that time, I was really shocked when I read this. I have always been concerned about my one-acre three-point land, work and life friends, and bigger things, such as the country and the earth’s environment, but I never thought about it, except for the earth. Besides civilization, are there other civilizations in the vast universe? There is another civilization similar to human beings, with a lower or higher level of evolution, and they are always looking for other civilizations. Wow, that’s so exciting to think about. In fact, in real life, the exploration and search for alien civilizations have been going on. SETI: Search For Extra Terrestrial Intelligence. This project was originally an experimental project initiated by American astronomer Frank Drake in 1960, using radio telescopes to detect the entire outer sky. Explain that radio telescopes are not detected by conventional optical telescopes through observation, but by receiving signals. In the Red Shore base in “Three-Body Problem”, there is a monitoring base station that receives signals from outer space, which is similar to that. Normally, it is noise. If there is a regular signal from outer space, it can be captured for interpretation and analysis. Radio telescopes It is similar to this. After this project has been going on for many years, it is a pity that there is no gain. After that, it is not enough to just listen to it, and you have to go out to find it, so there are some new actions in the follow-up. In 1972, the United States launched the unmanned planetary probe Pioneer 10. This probe flew freely into outer space. Of course, it also carried some gold leaf of human information. Now it seems to have flown out of Pluto, and we have to wait for the reply Hundreds of years.

The title of the second book is “Dark Forest”. Luo Ji also delayed the destruction of the earth through the law of the dark forest. It can be said that the law of the dark forest is the law of survival in the universe. Let me tell you about this. Cosmic civilization has two axioms: 1) Survival is the first need of civilization. 2) Civilizations keep growing and expanding, but the total amount of matter in the universe remains constant. Based on these two theorems, we can speculate and deduce the whole picture of the whole universe society. The first one is easy to understand, but the second one might say that the universe is so vast that there is no shortage of matter. Yes, the universe is big, but life is even bigger. The total amount of matter in the universe is basically constant, but life is growing exponentially. If we take a longer-term view, one million or ten million years from now, according to the current The development speed of the earth civilization can crowd the entire galaxy. Let’s list a few more concepts: **The goodwill and malice in civilizations impose restrictions on goodwill and malice in cosmic civilizations. Goodwill means not actively attacking and destroying other civilizations, while maliciousness is the opposite. ** **Chain of Suspicion. It refers to the endless suspicion established based on the axioms of cosmic civilization after the two civilizations formed exchanges. ** It’s hard to understand, right? It can be understood like this. For example, the earth has detected another civilization in outer space. The earth is a benevolent civilization, but the earth civilization doesn’t know what the other party thinks of me. I don’t know what the other party thinks and what I think about you. This chain of suspicion will continue to extend. This extension is related to the ecological circle we live in. On the earth, everyone belongs to the same species and lives in the same environment. The chain of suspicion may end at the third or third floor, but in the universe, each civilization is completely independent. In this case, the chain of suspicion will be infinitely magnified. Technology Explosion. This should be easy to understand. Human civilization has a history of 5,000 years, and the history of life on the earth lasts for billions of years. Modern technology has only been developed in 300 years. If you think about it, technological changes in 300 years have It is so big, and the earth is 300 years old. You have no reason to think that there is no civilization in the universe that is faster than the earth. So if a civilization knows that the civilization on the earth exists, even if it is weaker than you, it does not rule out the possibility of a technological explosion. It’s ahead of you. The technological explosion is irregular and instantaneous on the cosmic timeline. Having said the above, it is very easy to understand the law of the dark forest: **The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is a hunter with a gun, sneaking in the forest like a ghost, gently pushing aside the branches blocking the way, trying not to let the footsteps make a sound, and even breathing carefully.. …he must be careful, because the forest is full of hunters who are as sneaky as he is. If he finds any other life, hunter or not, angel or devil, tender baby or shambling old man, celestial maiden or celestial boy, there’s only one thing he can do : Shoot and destroy it. In this forest, hell is other people, an eternal threat, and any life that exposes its existence will be quickly wiped out. This is also an explanation of the Fermi paradox. ** This is the famous law of the dark forest, because Luo Ji has studied cosmic sociology and is well versed in this law, and of course the Trisolaran civilization, which is a higher civilization, is also well versed in this law. So Luo Ji has always been the mos","date":"2022-11-13 19:14:00","objectID":"/en/2022-07-17-%E4%B8%89%E4%BD%93%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/:0:5","tags":["Reading Arrangement","Life Perception"],"title":"《The Three-Body Problem》 Reading Notes","uri":"/en/2022-07-17-%E4%B8%89%E4%BD%93%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/"},{"categories":["Life Perception"],"content":"6 Don’t answer! Don’t answer! Don’t answer! The whole story starts from Ye Wenjie, a human on earth, and Trisolaris 1379, and the most ordinary ordinary people on these two planets decide the development and demise of two civilizations. After seeing this episode, I suddenly woke up from the drowsy plot before. The previous plot of the first part seemed a bit incomprehensible, but here the story reached its climax. A greeting was overheard by monitor 1379 on Trisolaran, and this life may change the crumbling civilization environment of Trisolaran. Since Trisolaris has three stars, their epochs are irregular. Constant epochs and chaotic epochs appear alternately, and there is no time law. The civilizations on Trisolarans have always been living in dire straits, and they must be dehydrated at any time. preparation. Due to the special living environment, Trisolarans are highly centralized and have no emotions. The way of communication is direct exchange of ideas without language packaging. Therefore, Trisolarans has been monitoring and exploring other civilizations in the universe, whether there is a better place to live environment of. According to common sense, this greeting from the earth is the life-saving straw of Trisolaran, which has been waiting for tens of thousands of years for an opportunity, but such a peace messenger like No. 1379, such a kind Trisolaran, reminded the earth out of kindness. Civilization does not answer, do not expose their position, this is how selfless, what a height of thought. When Ye Wenjie received the bad living conditions of Trisolarans introduced by No. 1379, Ye Wenjie finally sent a reply: **Come here, I will help you get this world, my civilization has been unable to solve its own problems, and needs Your power to intervene. ** Years later, Ye Wenjie became the spiritual leader of the Three-Body Rebel Army on Earth. She was an idealist, an extreme idealist. Her own miserable experience in society made her firmly believe that only a higher civilization can save the civilization of the earth, but that’s it. I also find it strange that a creator of disasters cannot be hated. In the last stage of her life, she was also the one who taught Luo Ji the law of the dark forest.

My emotions have reached their peak, and I just want to say that Luo Ji is the only man on earth, and he is also the character I admire and like the most in the whole play. Luo Ji is not a perfect protagonist. He has never advertised himself as a superhero, nor does he have that righteous and charismatic image. It is precisely because of this that he is sought after by many people. Before he became a Wallfacer, he was bohemian and unrestrained. He was proud of his talents. Not only was he proficient in physics, but he was also familiar with sociology and literature. Studying cosmic sociology was also because his unpopularity was beneficial to future job hunting. Little people of subsection. When the little people are chosen by history to shoulder the mission of saving the earth, how many people can maintain their original aspirations or bear the pressure? When Luo Ji was selected as a Wallfacer, his first reaction was to resolutely give up this mission and privilege. When he knew that he could not give up this identity, he was a very badass. He used the privilege to live his ideal life. What does the future of the earth have to do with me? ? There are still four centuries to go, isn’t it good to enjoy the present? Hahaha, it’s really too real, there are many ways to live in life, and grasping the present is obviously the best way to live.

Wow, this is true, how close to us, to be honest, isn’t the biggest thing for an ordinary person is that his wife and children are hot on the bed? What does the fate of the country and the earth have to do with me? Isn’t this the great wisdom of life? Seeing this is really touching.

Luo Ji’s life is too real, a bit like a true portrayal of Da Liu. I watched Liu’s interview before, talking about his views on fame, popularity, and literature. He also expressed very honestly that he wanted to sell more books and earn more money. It was so true. But Luo Ji’s strength is far more than that. When he changed from being a hero who saved mankind to being excluded by everyone, he still used his last strength to save mankind. I want to talk to the three-body world. Later, he became a sword holder, silently facing the wall and guarding the civilization of the earth for 50 years, and later the guardian of the earth’s tomb, ah, I just want to say: Looking at the history of mankind, his victory is unmatched. It is true that Luo Ji is more real than Cheng Xin. He can live for himself, and he can give his all when he is required to shoulder responsibilities.

So like Wade and Zhang Beihai, I will use them to motivate myself in the future on my life path. There is nothing to be afraid of, just do it.

There are two stories: **There is a sharpshooter who is practicing target shooting and punches a hole every 10cm. Imagine a two-dimensional intelligent creature living on this target. The scientists among them discovered a great law after observing their own universe: There must be a hole every 10cm, and they regard the random behavior of this sharpshooter as the iron law of their own civilization. ** ** There is a group of turkeys in a farm, and the farmer will feed them on time at 10 o’clock every morning. A scientist among the turkeys observed that this phenomenon has not changed for a year, so it also discovered the iron in the universe. Lil: Food arrives at 10 every morning. It announced this law to everyone on Thanksgiving, but this morning the food did not come at 10 o’clock, and the farmers came in and caught them all and killed them. ** These two interesting stories can also be compared to the civilization of the earth. We think that we are the center of the entire universe, and we are the highest civilization, but have you ever thought that the civilization of the earth may also be an accidental hole. In the face of a higher civilization, we A turkey at the mercy of others. There are many plots in “The Three-Body Problem” that describe the arrogance of human beings. The most impressive thing is that after the great trough, human industry has entered a new height, space technology is booming, and the space fleet is seriously waiting for the arrival of the Three-Body Fleet. Can wipe out the Trisolaran fleet with little effort. When I saw this paragraph, I thought that all the human beings on the earth had been stamped with ideological stamps, that is, the kind of stamps that firmly believe that human beings will win, but in fact there are no such stamps. This kind of arrogance is also the root of human beings. If the scars are healed, the pain is forgotten. After all, the earth civilization has been relatively peaceful since human beings, and there is no very harsh natural living environment. In this hotbed, it is inevitable to get carried away. When the drops of Trisolaran wiped out the human spaceships with little effort, everyone collapsed, the kind of hopeless collapse. There are also three-body water droplets threatening the earth. Luo Ji used the dark forest to deter the three-body army. The earth gained a short-term peace, and human beings were immersed in arrogance. The scars were healed and the pain was forgotten. Trisolarans did not give up any chance to occupy the heaven on earth in their eyes. They worked hard to learn the civilization of the earth, the culture of the earth, to supplement the disadvantages of their own civilization, etc., and finally found the opportunity. The earth army was defeated in one blow. Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, arrogance is! Weak I can gradually become stronger, and ignorant I can learn knowledge, but if I take the initiative to expose myself because I feel that I am the king of the universe, this is arrogance to the civilization of the universe, and this arrogance will also pay a heavy price!

Sometimes it is said to control the intake of carbohydrates and lipids every day, and it is said that it is enough to eat normally, which once made it difficult for me to choose. I accidentally listened to Fan Deng reading and explaining the book “Diet Technique”, and I trusted Teacher Fan Deng more. I believed that it should be an authoritative science popularization of conscience, so I read this book seriously. I really don’t know if I don’t read it. I was shocked when I read it. It overturned my previous cognition of diet. Many opinions in it are extremely bold. Both points are correct. As a programmer who lacks exercise every day, physical health is really important. As we grow older, various physical problems are more or less exposed, such as fatty liver, bulging belly, Obesity and more. And many times we don’t pay much attention to diet, and it’s not that we don’t pay attention to it. The main reason is that we don’t know anything about scientific eating habits, so we usually eat whatever we catch. This article is also after I read this book, I will refine some knowledge points in it, so that friends who don’t have time to read the whole book can quickly grasp the knowledge points in the book. About the Author Makita Zenji (Makita Zenji), Japanese, President of AGE Makita Specialist Hospital, Diabetes Specialist, Doctor of Medicine. 16 lies about diet I haven’t listed all 16 lies. Some of them are related to Japanese eating habits. We have no reference value here, so ignore them. Like most people may think that low fat is good, our body gets fat because we eat too much fat; and a balanced diet feels that we can control our body; weight loss will reduce muscle mass, etc. These can be said to be fake news, later you will learn what makes us fat, losing weight does not make muscles less and so on. Optimum intake of the three major nutrients The three major nutrients are: carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Sugar is a source of energy Lipids are the components that make up cell membranes Protein is an essential component of muscle and bone For the ingestion of these three, and the possible consequences of each ingestion, you can see the figure below. Looking at this picture can be extracted: **Be sure to reduce carbohydrate intake, and the settings can be replaced by lipids and proteins. For lipids, you should eat good lipids, eat more unsaturated fatty acid foods, and use less saturated fatty acid foods as much as possible. ** Eat various ingredients **Comprehensive diet, eating meat, whether it is fat or bone marrow, not even the genitals are left, all eaten. ** The more natural the better, ultra-processed food can induce cancer This picture lists some of the foods that should be used frequently and can replace carbohydrates. Fish and other meat should be taken alternately, and the intake of chicken should be more, the amount of pork should be moderate, and beef should be used occasionally. Ultimate body conditioning Eating too much white rice will shorten your lifespan, as long as you reduce your carbohydrate intake, your blood sugar will naturally normalize Intake more high-quality protein, choose tofu, natto, eggs, etc., and try your best to eat more vegetables Reduce salt intake Consciously and actively eat vegetables without pesticides, extra virgin olive oil, soybean products, mussels, chicken, etc., and never eat fast food and convenience store snacks French fries are the devil’s food to definitely avoid Chew and swallow slowly to stabilize blood sugar High temperature heating should be avoided, high temperature heating food will make it age quickly Shellfish and seaweed are rich in magnesium, and darker vegetables, beans, eggs, and fungi are also rich in magnesium Eating less and eating more is good for health, skipping breakfast will accelerate aging and diabetes Cod liver oil","date":"2022-09-27 19:14:00","objectID":"/en/2022-2-14-%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E5%91%98%E8%A6%81%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E4%BF%9D%E6%8C%81%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E8%AF%BB%E5%AE%8C%E6%A8%8A%E7%99%BB%E6%8E%A8%E8%8D%90%E7%9A%84%E9%A5%AE%E9%A3%9F%E6%9C%AF/:0:0","tags":["Reading Arrangement","Life Perception"],"title":"How can programmers stay healthy?

In the Linux system, the directory is also a kind of file. Opening the directory is actually opening the file in the directory. The directory file is a collection of file names and iNode node information under the directory. The iNode node that reads the file needs to execute the permission. Through this, it is easy to understand the relationship between the directory permission and the file permission. If the directory does not have execution permission, basically nothing can be done, and some information of the files under the directory cannot be read. Execution permission is very important for directory permissions. Except for root privileges, root privileges are basically superman, wearing underwear outside, and will not be affected in any way. 3.2 Hard link With the understanding of iNode, it is easier to understand and use some links in Linux. As mentioned above, generally a file name and an iNode number have a one-to-one correspondence, but multiple identical file names can also correspond to an iNode number. In this way, different file names can be used to access the same content. Modifying the file content will affect all files pointing to this iNode; but deleting a file or file will not affect another file’s access to this iNode. This is the hard link that is used a lot. After mastering the iNode, it is easier to understand the hard link. The actual content of the file is only related to the iNode node, and has nothing to do with the file name. I created a hard link to test.txt, and you can see that the iNode values of the two files are the same. You can also see that the number of links is 2. If one of the files is deleted, the number of links will be reduced by 1, and the iNode number will be recycled when it reaches 0. Here is the iNode of the directory. After the directory is created, two directories will be generated by default: ‘.’ and ‘..’. The iNode number of the former is the iNode number of the current directory, and the iNode number of the latter is the iNode number of the parent directory of the current directory. 3.3 Soft link There is also a soft link, also called a symbolic link, which means that the iNodes of the two files A and B are different, but the content of file A is the path of file B, and the system will automatically point the access to B, so no matter which file is opened, File B that is both operational. So file A depends on file B. If file B is deleted, file A will not be opened. The difference between this and the hard link is that file A points to the file name of file B, not the iNode number of file B. 4 Solution to iNode resource exhaustion Back to the question at the beginning of the article, through df -i, my iNode usage is already 100%, how to solve it? The basic idea is to find the path of the file handle. Generally, if the iNode is exhausted, there must be a process or task that has been creating files, resulting in exhaustion. View the directory with the most files for i in /*; do echo $i; find $i | wc -l; done If you determine which directory, you can /* write specific points. Delete a large number of files ls | xargs -n 1000 rm -rf Just delete it, use the xargs command. Avoid this mass creation of files after you find the problem.

Ansible ping module usage Scenario analysis: Use Ansible’s ping module to test the connectivity of other hosts. Problem analysis and solution: The first is to copy the ssh key to the target host to enable it to log in without secrets. Here to mention the process of ssh logging in to other hosts. The ssh password login is encrypted with RSA, which is asymmetric encryption. The source host first generates a pair of public-private key pairs and stores them in the path of the source host.

We know that, in fact, a single-core CPU can only run one process at a time point, which is also the most ideal state, so if at a certain point in time, how many A process is grabbing the CPU, which is actually not good, and the average load will increase. The uninterruptible state refers to those IO processes, such as reading and writing hardware in the kernel mode. The system is unwilling to interrupt such processes. So it is easy to understand that a high average load does not necessarily mean a high CPU utilization rate. For example, if there are many IO processes, the CPU utilization rate may not be high at this time. While the CPU utilization rate is high, the average load is not necessarily high. For example, if multiple threads are using the CPU in a single process, the CPU utilization rate is also high at this time, but the average load is not high.

This is the pidstat command, you can view the CPU usage of the process, of course you can also use the top command. But this command can view the CPU usage of kernel mode and user mode. Use the uptime command to view the average load. So it can be seen that the CPU utilization rate is 100% at this time, and the average load is not very outrageous.

CPU context switching CPU context switching is a very important performance indicator of the Linux system, and frequent context switching will affect the performance of the system. What is context switching? Generally speaking, when the current process or thread exits the CPU, the system will save the CPU register and program counter of the previous process or thread, and then load the CPU register and program counter of the process or thread to run , to run the new task. Switching and saving this time is the key to affecting performance. Context switching is also divided into the following situations. Process context switching The process is divided into user mode and kernel mode. The kernel mode means that the process needs to interact with the Linux kernel, and the user mode does not need to interact with the Linux kernel. Therefore, process context switching is also divided into two situations, one is that the process transfers from user mode to kernel mode, and the other is switching between two processes. From user mode to kernel mode, let’s take a look at what this does. The operating levels of Linux can be divided into the following figure, Ring 0 is the highest level, the authority is also the largest, and it directly interacts with the kernel. Ring 3 is in user mode, with limited permissions, and can only access kernel resources through system calls. For a call from user mode to kernel mode, the CPU actually performs two context switches. The first time is to save the instruction position of the user mode, execute the kernel code, update the kernel instruction, and jump to the kernel for execution; after execution , to restore to the user state, the CPU registers restore the original saved user state, and then switch to the user space. So two context switches happen. Compared with system calls, the context switching of the inter-process kernel mode requires more information to be saved. For example, when a CPU process is switched from one to another, not only the CPU registers and program calculator must be saved, but also the virtual memory, stack, etc. . So resource consumption and time will be more. Thread context switching A thread is a task running in a process. If there is only one thread in a process, thread switching can be considered as switching between processes. When there are multiple threads in a process, because multiple threads share the virtual memory and global variables of the process, the CPU only needs to save the private data, registers and unshared resources of the threads when switching between threads. Switching is much more efficient than switching between processes. interrupt context switch The priority of the interrupted process is higher than that of the ordinary process, and the interrupted process occurs in the kernel mode, so the interrupted process interrupts the process of the user mode, and there is no need to save and restore user resources such as virtual memory and global variables of this process. The interrupt context actually only includes the state required for the execution of the kernel mode interrupt service program, including CPU registers, kernel stack, hardware interrupt parameters, etc. ","date":"2021-09-28 11:14:00","objectID":"/en/2020-12-13-linux-%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E5%8F%8A%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96/:0:3","tags":["Operation and Maintenance","Operating System"],"title":"Linux problem location and performance optimization","uri":"/en/2020-12-13-linux-%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E5%8F%8A%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96/"},{"categories":["Operation Related Knowledge"],"content":"3. Uninterruptible and zombie processes Let’s first review the several states of the process, which should be checked frequently during normal analysis and viewing. R: running state process D: Uninterruptible state process, generally when the process interacts with the hardware, the interactive process is not allowed to be interrupted by other processes or interrupts Z: Zombie state. This is after the child process exits, the parent process does not recycle the child process, resulting in a zombie state. Generally, the parent process has a wait function to recycle the status of the child process S: The status process can be interrupted. Indicates that the process is suspended by the system because it is waiting for an event, and can be awakened into the ready and running state T: Suspended state, for example, when the process is running, after sending a SIGSTOP signal, the process is in a suspended state, and can be resumed by the fg command I: Idle Therefore, when performing system analysis, if there are a large number of unavailable state processes, that is, D state processes, the IO problem of the system must be considered. As for the zombie process, under normal circumstances, it will not affect the performance of the system, but if there are a large number of zombie processes, the PID number of the system may be used up. To clean up the zombie process, you can kill the parent process or wait for the init process to recycle.

Analyze CPU performance indicators This is also the most critical part of the practical part, that is, if there is a CPU problem, from what angles can we analyze it? First, it must be the CPU usage rate. The CPU usage rate includes user CPU, kernel CPU, waiting for IO, interrupt, and stealing CPU. Client CPU. The second is context switching. The third is the average load. Fourth, the hit rate of the CPU cache. There is a cache between the CPU and the memory, and hot data is usually written into the cache. The hit rate of the cache can greatly improve the performance of the CPU. Let’s briefly talk about voluntary and involuntary context switching. ***Voluntary context switching: refers to the context switching caused by the inability of the process to obtain the required resources. Such as IO, memory and other resources are insufficient. *** Involuntary context switching: the inter-process time slice has been exhausted, and is forced to be scheduled by the system, and then the context switching occurs ","date":"2021-09-28 11:14:00","objectID":"/en/2020-12-13-linux-%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E5%8F%8A%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96/:0:5","tags":["Operation and Maintenance","Operating System"],"title":"Linux problem location and performance optimization","uri":"/en/2020-12-13-linux-%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E5%8F%8A%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E4%BC%98%E5%8C%96/"},{"categories":["Operation Related Knowledge"],"content":"5.

Background introduction 1.1 Prometheus The Chinese is Prometheus, just by hearing the name, I feel very fanciful, and it is a very powerful thing. Let me talk about the story of Prometheus, he is a figure in the myth of Athens, the legend is that he fabricated the human form, and Athena gave each human form a soul. Zeus forbids humans to use fire. Seeing that humans are in distress, this buddy stole fire from Apollo, so he offended Zeus. After that, Zeus locked him on the cliff of Caucasus Mountain and released a fire every day. The evil eagle pecked at his liver, and made his liver grow back every day, making him suffer all kinds of pain. This myth is quite interesting, so we can see that Prometheus is the patron saint of mankind. He came to endure all kinds of suffering and protect mankind. So what I’m talking about today also has this function, it’s a performance monitoring tool, it’s an open-source monitoring \u0026 alarming system based on time series written in Go language. It is based on the HTTP protocol to capture the status information of the monitored point, so it supports a wide range of components. Any component that supports the HTTP protocol can use it as a monitored point, so it is also widely used in docker, k8s and mesos environments. monitor. The HTTP interface for outputting the monitored component information is exporter. Currently, many commonly used components of Internet companies can directly use exporter. 1.2 Grafana An open source program for visualizing large measurement data, providing a powerful and elegant way to create, share, and browse data.

Practical drills I used vagrant + virtual Box to set up three instances, and the process in the middle was full of twists and turns. The main reason was that I was not familiar with vagrant. In fact, vagrant is an isolation of the development environment, which is a bit like docker, through box mirroring To isolate different development environments. When using vagrant, I reviewed the network configuration, mainly the difference between NAT, bridge, host-only, switch and router. Let’s talk about the difference between a switch and a router first. This should be encountered frequently. First of all, the two levels in the OSI seven-layer model are different. The switch is at the second layer, the data link layer, and the router is at the second layer. It is in the third layer, the network layer. The switch uses the physical address to determine the destination address of the data, and the router uses the network ID number to address. The different ways of the two are destined to have different functions. A switch can be understood as having more LAN ports, and the network of each LAN port does not interfere with each other. The router is just the opposite. Multiple LAN ports share a total network port, so it is a shared network bandwidth. NAT: Network address translation is the function of the virtual machine to access the public network through the network where the host machine is located through the NAT function. In NAT mode, other hosts in the LAN cannot access the virtual machine, and the virtual machine can access all hosts in the LAN. Bridging: The local physical network card and the virtual network card are bridged through the virtual switch, and the virtual switch is equivalent to the switch in the real network. host-only: The virtual network is in a fully closed network, and the only thing that can be accessed is the host. There are three instances in total, one is to install prometheus, one is to install granfan, and the other is to install node_exporter. Install and start prometheus wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.7.1/prometheus-2.7.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf prometheus-2.7.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/ mv prometheus-2.7.1.linux-amd64 prometheus ./prometheus --config.file=\"prometheus.yml\" \u0026 (background running) lsof -i:9090 (list port process) After finishing, start prometheus, the port occupied is port 9090, and the performance monitoring starts. Setting the target is the monitoring target. By default, the monitoring target is yourself, and you can also set other node nodes for monitoring. Install and start the node_exporter node curl -OL https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v0.15.2/node_exporter-0.15.2.darwin-amd64.tar.gz tar -xzf node_exporter-0.15.2.darwin-amd64.tar.gz nohup /usr/local/node_exporter/node_exporter This starts node_exporter, and you can see it after entering it. In fact, it is a bunch of logs like the picture below. These logs can be called and displayed by prometheus. Granfan installation and startup This is a performance monitoring tool with a graphical interface, and it is very simple to install and start. sudo apt-get install grafana service grafana-server start Prometheus can be added to monitoring with dashboard through Grafana.

Basic concepts 2.1 Nginx description Nginx is a reverse proxy web server for http, which performs well in concurrency and can withstand up to 50,000 concurrency. So it is also favored by many companies. Including Baidu, JD.com, Sina, Tencent, Taobao, etc. 2.2 Reverse Proxy and Forward Proxy A forward proxy is a proxy client, and the server is insensitive to requests from different clients. A better example is the use of VPN. For example, when we use Google over the wall, it is actually a forward proxy. The user is equivalent to visiting the Google website, but it is actually sent to the VPN server, and the VPN server communicates with Google. Interactive communication, and then return the content to the client. Forward proxying requires client browsers to be configured. A reverse proxy is just the opposite and is used to proxy the server. The client is indifferent to the server. For example, if a user wants to access multiple tomcat servers on the server, he can access the reverse proxy server, and then the reverse proxy server communicates with tomcat to return the content to the client. So the reverse proxy is the configuration server. 2.3 Load Balancing Load balancing is equivalent to using the load balancing server to distribute the client’s request to each server according to the load balancing configuration. 2.4 Dynamic and Static Separation Dynamic and static separation is equivalent to separating the dynamic resources of the server from the static resources, and using nginx to point to different servers.

Reverse Proxy Practice Use Nginx to proxy the tomcat server. My virtual machine ip is 192.168.2.5, and listen to port 9001 in the Nginx configuration file.

Create edu files and html files in 8080, create vod folders and html files in 8081, and access the two via 192.168.2.5:9001:/edu/a.html and 192.168.2.5:9001:/vod/a.html A tomcat server. Mainly the configuration of nginx.conf, the following is the configuration instructions. There is also tomcat’s 8081 server configuration file to modify the default listening port 8080 to 8081. server { listen 9001; server_name 192.168.2.5; location ~ /edu/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; } location ~ /vod/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081; } } Location ~ is used to determine whether it exists, and proxy_pass is used to point to the tomcat server. This block is configured in the http block of nginx.conf. Through this experiment, you can see the reverse proxy of Nginx. Nginx acts as a proxy for two tomcat servers, and users can access different servers only by accessing port 9001.

Polling Each request is assigned to a different tomcat server one by one. Equivalent to equal opportunity. The configuration is as follows: upstream myserver { server 192.168.2.5:8080; server 192.168.2.5:8081; } server { listen 80; server_name 192.168.2.5; location / { proxy_pass http://myserver; } } In this way, when a request comes, it will patrol to access the two tomcat servers. weight method Weights can be assigned to each tomcat server, and requests will dynamically fall to different servers with more weight. upstream myserver { server 192.168.2.5:8080 weight=5; server 192.168.2.5:8081 weight=10; } server { listen 80; server_name 192.168.2.5; location / { proxy_pass http://myserver; } } After this configuration, the request will probabilistically fall to the two servers according to the weight. Ip_hash method This means that the request will only fall to the server accessed for the first time, and will not be changed to other servers. This can solve the session problem. upstream myserver { ip_hash; server 192.168.2.5:8080 weight=5; server 192.168.2.5:8081 weight=10; } server { listen 80; server_name 192.168.2.5; location / { proxy_pass http://myserver; } } ","date":"2021-05-13 11:14:00","objectID":"/en/2020-11-13-nginx-practice/:0:5","tags":["Operation and Maintenance、Network"],"title":"Nginx Practice","uri":"/en/2020-11-13-nginx-practice/"},{"categories":["Operation and Maintenance Related Knowledge"],"content":"6.

High availability simulation The high availability of Nginx means that two nginx servers are used as master-slave services. When the master server goes down, it can automatically switch to the slave server. The switching and monitoring of Nginx is realized by keepalived. A script will be defined in keepalived to monitor the status of nginx threads all the time. Once the status changes, it will switch to another slave server. The above is the whole flowchart. The virtual ip 192.168.2.50 is a virtual ip set by keepalived. There is a nginx_check.sh script, which will run this script every 2s. This script is used to detect nginx threads. If there is no nginx The thread will kill the keepalive, and the service will be directed to the slave server.

Basic principles of Nginx The architecture of Nginx is that the main process of a master starts as a daemon process, and multiple work processes are attached to the master process, as shown in the figure below. Each work process is equivalent to a reverse proxy server. Each work process competes to grab requests. The benefits of this approach: Support hot deployment. When nginx.conf is changed, even if there are work processes processing transactions, it will not be affected. The config file will be synchronized to the work process that has not performed the transaction, and will be synchronized after the task is completed. Each work process can run independently without locking, saving the cost of locking. The maximum number of connections supported by each work is 4, and it is best to keep the optimum number of workers consistent with the number of CPU cores.

What is HTTP HTTP (hypertext transport protocol), is the hypertext transfer protocol, text can be understood as characters, text, audio and video, etc. Hypertext is not a simple text file, but a more complex mixture of various files. In fact, it is very easy to understand. HTTP is actually an application layer protocol. Well, let’s review the seven-layer model of the network. Application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer, link layer, physical layer. This figure is still very comprehensive, outlining the scope of the functions of each layer of the entire seven-layer model. HTTP is an application layer protocol.

Different versions of HTTP This was still asked during the interview, so let’s talk about it too. Currently, the http version has undergone four changes: HTTP 0.9 –\u003e HTTP 1.0 –\u003e HTTP 1.1 –\u003e HTTP 1.2 HTTP 0.9 The first version, this version only supports GET requests, and can only respond to HTML strings. HTTP 1.0 Added post, delete, put. And the concept of request header and response header is added, and the version number, status code, encoding and other content of the HTTP protocol are specified, and it also supports the transmission of pictures, audio and video, binary and other content. HTTP 1.1 Added long links, added pipeline processing, cache processing and breakpoint transmission. Pipelining means that multiple HTTP requests can be sent at the same time without waiting for responses one by one. For resuming uploads from breakpoints, the client will record the current download progress, and then notify the server of the content fragments that need to be downloaded this time when resuming the upload is required. The long link will be explained in detail below. 2.1 The difference between long links and short links In fact, it is very easy to understand. The long connection means that after the client and the server establish a connection, they will keep the connection state, and there is no need to disconnect after the end of a request; the short connection is the opposite, and the connection will be disconnected after each request. So their advantages and disadvantages are very obvious. The long connection saves connection and closing time and reduces waste. But there will also be a problem, that is, as the number of connections increases, the connection between the client and the server will always be maintained, which will bring some problems, and the server will definitely be overwhelmed. For this situation, there are also solutions. When After the number of connections reaches a certain number, the server can actively close some event connections that have not been read or written for a long time. Relatively speaking, the problem of short connections will be more serious, because each request needs to establish a connection, and then disconnect it. If it is a service that is frequently requested, it will take up a lot of resources. Therefore, whether it is a long connection or a short connection, it is determined according to specific needs.

Some elements of HTTP 3.1 HTTP message This is the format of the HTTP message. The upper one is the request body, and the lower one is the returned thing. The details are as follows: 3.2 URIs What is the difference between URI and URL, and what is URI used for? URI is Uniform Resource Identifier. It is used to define the address of the server to be accessed. URI is composed of URL and URN. 3.3 Cookies Because HTTP is stateless, what does it mean, that is, the protocol has no memory ability for transaction processing, and the server side does not know the specific situation of the client side. The introduction of cookies is to solve this problem. The browser is responsible for storing cookies, not the operating system. If you change a server, you will not know. 3.4 session Session is used to track clients, that is, to distinguish specific clients, but its implementation is implemented through cookies. What does it mean? When the client sends a request, there will be a cookie. If the server wants to track the client’s information, it will record a session id in the cookie. The next time the client requests again, it will use this session id, and when the server returns information, it will also find the client based on this session id. It can be said that they complement each other.

HTTPS Everyone knows that HTTPS is a more secure communication protocol than HTTP. HTTP message content is plain text, while HTTPS encrypts the message for transmission, so the security will be better. The difference between HTTPS and HTTP is shown in the figure below. HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL. HTTPS has a handshake process before establishing communication, that is, before the client and server establish a connection, they must be encrypted by symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. Only after the client and server are both verified, can the connection be established and transmitted message. The specific process can be seen in the figure below. The specific process can be as follows: The browser first sends the encryption rules it supports to the website, and the website will select a set of encryption algorithms and HASH algorithms, and send back its identity information to the browser in the form of a certificate, which contains the website address, public key, and information about the issuing authority of the certificate. After the browser receives the certificate, it will generate a string of random numbers, encrypt the random numbers with the public key, calculate the handshake information with the agreed HASH algorithm, encrypt it with the random numbers, and then send it to the client. After receiving it, the client first decrypts it with the private key, takes out the random number password, and then decrypts the handshake information with the random number password to verify whether the HASH algorithm is consistent with the one sent in for the first time, and then encrypts a piece of handshake information with the password. sent to the browser. The browser decrypts and calculates the HASH of the handshake information. If it is consistent with the server, the whole process ends, and all subsequent communication data will be encrypted based on the encryption algorithm.

Forward And Reverse Proxy The forward proxy is a proxy server between the client and the target server. In order to obtain content from the original server, the client sends a request to the proxy server, and specifies the target server, after which the proxy transfers to the target server and returns the obtained content to the client. Like this, you can’t reach the www.google.com if you have direct access. But you can use the forward proxy. In the forward proxy, the real client is invisible to the server. The final result is that you can access the www.google.com site via the proxy server. This is the forward proxy. Okay, now we can compare the reverse proxy. It’s just the opposite. To the client, the reverse proxy is like the target server.The client doesn’t need to make any settings. The client sends a request to the reverse proxy, and then the reverse proxy determines where the request is going, and forwards the request to the client. Like above, the reverse proxy is to proxy the server, it’s very common. For example, you everyday visit the www.google.com, it’s actually a reverse proxy, you don’t know the real server address.

Linear structure: The relationship between data elements is one-to-one, and the data elements echo each other stack queue linear table array string Non-linear structure: the relationship between elements is not one-to-one, and each element may have a relationship with zero or more other data Two-dimensional array Multidimensional Arrays generalized table Tree picture So the concept of a tree is very clear. It is a nonlinear structure with a root, and each layer under the root is a child node, which also constitutes a tree, a typical recursion.

The deeper the depth, the higher the time complexity. Here comes the balanced binary tree. Concept: Balanced Binary Tree (Balanced Binary Tree), also called AVL tree. First, a balanced binary tree must be a binary search tree. Secondly, the absolute value of the height difference between its left and right subtrees does not exceed 1, and both left and right subtrees are a balanced binary tree. The binary search tree can adjust the search tree through the balance factor.

The background of HashMap In this part, we first introduce hash tables and hashes from the advantages and disadvantages of arrays and linked lists. Take a look at the characteristics of hash tables and hashes compared to the first two. 1.1 Advantages and disadvantages of arrays First look at the memory structure diagram of the array. Looking at this picture, you should clearly see the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the array. Arrays are characterized by sequential storage and a fixed length of length It is very convenient to find data in the array, you can directly read the data at a fixed position according to the index (advantage) It is very troublesome to add and delete data in the array, you need to expand the array first, and then reassign the array (disadvantage) 1.2 Advantages and disadvantages of linked list Let’s take a look at the memory structure diagram of the linked list. There are also many kinds of linked lists, one-way, two-way, circular, etc. Let’s take a single linked list as an example. In the above two pictures, the first one is the memory structure diagram of the linked list. It can be seen that the structure of the linked list has a data area and an address area, and the address area points to the next element in turn. The insertion and deletion operations of the linked list are also very convenient, just point the address of the previous one to the element to be inserted. So from the linked list we can also get the following characteristics. The length of the linked list is not fixed and can be dynamically adjusted as needed The search of the linked list will be very troublesome, it cannot be searched according to the index, and it needs to be traversed from beginning to end one by one (disadvantage) The insertion and deletion operations of the linked list are very convenient (advantage) 1.3 Hash tables and hashes Having said so much, I have listed the advantages and disadvantages of the first two data structures. Is there a data structure that can combine the advantages of the above two at the same time? This is about the hash table. Let’s take a look at the structure of the hash table. This is the memory structure diagram of the hash table. You can take a look, it is divided into two parts, the purple part on the left is an array structure, each array has a head pointer of a linked list, and the green part on the right is a linked list structure, which is used to resolve conflicts. The hash table is a feature that integrates the two data structures of arrays and linked lists. Hash is an algorithm whose principle is to convert an input of any length into a fixed-length output. The method of this mapping is the Hash algorithm. The Hash algorithm has the following characteristics: No reverse derivation is possible. It means that the original data cannot be deduced from the results Any minor change to the original data will result in a different result The execution efficiency of the Hash algorithm is very high Hash algorithm has collision probability. Because the input space is much larger than the output space, there may be different input to get the same output problem ","date":"2020-12-03 10:14:00","objectID":"/en/2020-05-07-hashmap/:0:1","tags":["Data Structures","Algorithms"],"title":"HashMap","uri":"/en/2020-05-07-hashmap/"},{"categories":["Algorithms-Data Structures"],"content":"2. HashMap principle 2.1 Physical structure of HashMap Having said so much earlier, HashMap can be easily understood, which is a hash table implemented by the Hash algorithm. See the picture below. It is array + linked list + red-black tree structure. The linked list is a linked list added to the array structure when there are conflicting elements. When the number of linked list nodes is greater than or equal to 8, and the number of all elements in the hash table is greater than 64, the linked list structure will be upgraded to a red-black tree structure. 2.1 HashMap insert data process You can look at this picture, this process is the process of inserting data into HashMap. First of all, the inserted key is converted into a hash value through the hash algorithm, and then the hash value is passed through the disturbance function to make the hash value more hashed, and then the node node of the hash is constructed, and then according to the routing algorithm, it is calculated that the node node should be inserted into which location. You can look at this routing formula, table length is the length of the hash array, generally the power of 2, and then element with the hash value to get the insertion position, and insert this node into the node of the hashmap. 2.2 Hash collision As mentioned earlier, when two different inputs get the same hash value, or when there is a conflict in the calculated node position according to the routing formula, a Hash collision will also occur. After a Hash collision occurs, a linked list will be formed at the array nodes. 2.3 Hash Expansion It can be seen that if the size of the Hash array is limited, Hash collisions will easily occur. After a Hash collision occurs, the length of the linked list will become longer and longer. As a result, the advantages of HashMap cannot be used, and the linked list will be relied on. So in order to solve this problem, it is necessary to expand the Hash. After expansion, collisions can be effectively reduced.

HashMap source code analysis 3.1 C++ Key-Value container JAVA’s HashMap uses JDK. C++ has many key-value containers, map / hash_map / unordered_map / vector_map. Map is implemented with a red-black tree, and it takes a long time to build a map. vector_map is not implemented in c++. The basic idea is to use vector to save data, sort after insertion, and then use binary search. The implementation of hash_map and STL is called unordered_map, which are all implemented based on hash_table. First, a large area of memory is allocated to form many buckets, and the keys are mapped to different buckets using the hash function. The search speed of hash_map is faster than that of map, and its search speed has nothing to do with the size of the data, which belongs to the constant level. The search speed of map is log(n) level. 3.2 HashMap source code ","date":"2020-12-03 10:14:00","objectID":"/en/2020-05-07-hashmap/:0:3","tags":["Data Structures","Algorithms"],"title":"HashMap","uri":"/en/2020-05-07-hashmap/"},{"categories":["Life Perception"],"content":"Life perception","date":"2020-11-28 19:14:00","objectID":"/en/2021-3-14-%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E4%BD%8F%E6%88%BF%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D/","tags":["Life Perception","Housing"],"title":"Singapore Housing Introduction","uri":"/en/2021-3-14-%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E4%BD%8F%E6%88%BF%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D/"},{"categories":["Life Perception"],"content":"***The following content is for reference only and does not involve any investment.

Types of housing in Singapore Housing in Singapore is divided into HDB flats planned and built by the government, executive condominiums, and private commercial housing. Among them, private commercial housing is divided into landed housing and non-landed housing (ie apartments). HDB (House\u0026Development Board)-built HDB flats and executive condominiums are all 99-year leasehold**, private residences are built by private real estate developers with 99-year, 999-year and permanent leaseholds difference. Government Housing Estate Most of the Singapore residents buy government HDB flats, which are welfare housing for Singapore citizens and permanent residents. (1) 2-room HDB: 1 bedroom, with a usable area of about 45 square meters. (2) 3-room flat: 2 bedrooms, with a usable area of about 70 square meters. (3) 4-room flat: 3 bedrooms, with a usable area of about 80-105 square meters. (4) 5-room flat: 3/4 bedrooms, with a usable area of about 110-125 square meters. (5) Executive Apartment (EA): 3/4 bedrooms with an area of about 150 square meters. (6) Executive Duplex Apartment (EM): Same as Executive Apartment, but double-storey. HDB Condominium Executive Condominium (EC): Commercial housing developed by private real estate developers**, the price is cheaper than private commercial housing, and the apartment facilities are almost the same. Only Singapore citizens can buy it. After 5 years, it can be sold to Singapore permanent residents. After 10 years, it will be automatically privatized and become a commercial apartment for sale to foreigners. Private Apartment This category is for foreigners, and there are no restrictions on foreigners. There is a clubhouse, playground, gym, swimming pool, tennis courts and BBQ stations with 24 hour security surveillance. **(1) Condo/Apartment: **Standard apartment facilities. Such as swimming pool, 24-hour security, library, gym, basketball court, tennis court, etc. **(2) High-rise apartment (HiRise): ** There are some apartment facilities, but there may be no basketball court, general gym, 24-hour security, and swimming pool. **(3) Low-rise apartment (LoRise): **There are some apartment facilities. For example, swimming pool, gym. **(4) WalkUp: **A low-rise apartment without an elevator and without any apartment facilities. Landed Property This type is private property with private gardens and garages. Foreigners are not allowed to buy it, and permanent residents are not allowed to buy it in principle. People who have made special contributions can buy it with government approval. **(1) Detached villa: **There are no walls or fences connecting with other houses on the four sides of the villa, with an area of more than 400 square meters and a maximum building height of three floors. **(2) Semi-detached villa: **The house is connected side by side with the neighboring house on one side, with an area of more than 200 square meters and a maximum building height of three floors. **(3) Conjoined villas (row houses): **A group of houses connected side by side, with an area of more than 150 square meters. **(4) Corner row house: ** The house on both sides of the row house. **(5) High-quality villa: **The area is more than 1,400 square meters.

Restrictions on purchasing BTO (new HDB flats) BTO is build to order, pre-sale of HDB flats. It is sold first and then built. It is a bit like a group purchase. It takes about 3-4 years from application for purchase to handover and key collection. The advantage of BTO is that the price will be cheaper than resale HDB, and you can also enjoy government subsidies according to your situation, so most people will give priority to buying BTO. But the problem is that it takes a long time to hand over the house, and the identity will be stricter. INCOME LIMITATION 4-room or larger HDB flats (including executive condominium EC): The family income cannot exceed SGD 12,000 per month. If the HDB flat is purchased in a cross-generational joint name (for example, with the parent/parent), The family income ceiling is S$18,000. 3-room HDB flat: For non-mature community HDB flats, the income limit at the time of purchase is SGD 6,000 or SGD 12,000 per month, depending on different projects. The income ceiling for HDB flats in mature communities is fixed at SGD 12,000 per month. Resale HDB: No income restrictions. OTHER RESTRICTIONS At least one of the buyers must be 21 years old.

Resale HDB flats will become less and less valuable as the house ages. New resale flats will be more expensive.

Buyers who bought a house after January 14, 2011 only need to pay the seller’s stamp duty within 3 years of buying the house, and they don’t have to pay any more after selling it after holding it for more than 3 years.

Actually, kubeadm aims to create the implement the k8s environment, so it will create the kubenetes master node when you execute the kubeadm init command. Then you can arrange other nodes to this master node. So my solution is like this. At first, create a new instance, then in this instance configure the container, kubectl, kubelet and kubeadm tools.

Performing an automatic rolling update with a RC apiVersion: v1 kind: ReplicationController metadata: name: kubia-v1 spec: replicas: 3 template: metadata: name: kubia labels: app: kubia spec: containers: - image: luksa/kubia:v1 name: nodejs --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: kubia spec: type: NodePort selector: app: kubia ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 8080 nodePort: 30007 To run this app, will create a ReplicationController and NodePort service to enable to access the app externally. Then open another terminal to monitor the service. Then performing a rolling update with kubectl, will create version 2 of the app. Execute below command: kubectl rolling-update kubia-v1 kubia-v2 --image=luksa/kubia:v2 Using Deployment for updating apps declaratively A deployment is a high-level resource meant for deploying applications and updating them declaratively, instead of doing it through a RC or RS, which are both considered lower-level concepts. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: kubia-v1 spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: kubia template: metadata: name: kubia labels: app: kubia spec: containers: - image: luksa/kubia:v1 name: nodejs --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: kubia spec: type: NodePort selector: app: kubia ports: - port: 80 Also to run this application, after completed, change the v1 deployment container to v2, then deploy with the new version. kubectl apply -f kubia-deploy-v2.yaml After that, you can notice that there will reserve the V1 RS. So it’s very easy to rollback the version from V2 to V1. Use this command to roll back the deployment. kubectl rollout undo deployment kubia kubectl rollout history deployment kubia kubectl rollout undo deployment kubia --to-revision=1 Blue / Green Actually this deployment needs V1 and V2 applications are existing.

External Cluster Network How to access the k8s cluster network from outside? There are 3 ways to build the network model. 3.1. LoadBalacer A LoadBalacer Service is the standard way to expose a service to the internet. But only on the AWS or Google Cloud can use this function. On GKE, this will spin up a network load balancer that will give you a single IP address that will forward all traffic to your service. If you want to want to directly expose a service, this is the default method. All traffic on the port you specify will be forwarded to the service.There is no filtering, no routing, etc. This means you can send almost any kind of traffic to it, like HTTP, TCP, UDP. Websocket, gRPC, or whatever. The big downside is that each service you expose with a LoadBalancer will get its own IP address, and you have to pay for a LoadBalancer per exposed service, which can get expensive. 3.2. NodePort A NodePort service is the most primitive way to get external traffic directly to your service. NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port on all the Node, and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service. 3.3. Ingress Unlike all the above examples, Ingress is actually not a type of service. Instead, it sits in front of multiple services and act as a “smart router” or entry point into your cluster.You can do a lot of different things with an Ingress, and there are many types of Ingress controllers that have different capabilities. apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: my-ingress spec: backend: serviceName: other servicePort: 8080 rules: - host: foo.mydomain.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: foo servicePort: 8080 - host: mydomain.com http: paths: - path: /bar/* backend: serviceName: bar servicePort: 8080 ","date":"2020-03-13 16:11:51","objectID":"/en/2020-4-23-k8s-network/:0:3","tags":["K8S","microservice"],"title":"K8S Network","uri":"/en/2020-4-23-k8s-network/"},{"categories":["K8S-study notes"],"content":"K8S study notes","date":"2020-02-28 09:11:51","objectID":"/en/2020-4-11-health-check/","tags":["K8S","microservice"],"title":"Health Check","uri":"/en/2020-4-11-health-check/"},{"categories":["K8S-study notes"],"content":"1. About K8S health check Health check is the important feature of the k8s orchestrating. K8s can monitor those containers and automatically restart them if they fail. If the container’s main process crashes, the k8s will restart the container. Also if your application has a bug that causes it to crash every once in a while, k8s will restart it automatically.There are two kinds of ways for health check. Liveness and Readiness. What’s the difference? And how to use these? liveness probes k8s can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes. You can specify a liveness probe for each container in the pod’s specification. k8s will periodically execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails. The liveness health check configure file. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: test: liveness name: liveness spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: - name: liveness image: busybox args: - /bin/sh - -c - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 60 livenessProbe: exec: command: - cat - /tmp/healthy initialDelaySeconds: 10 periodSeconds: 5 From this configure file, we define the livenessProbe. Every 5 seconds, the probe will detect and execute the command. If failed, will restart the pod again. The Readiness health check configure file. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: test: readiness name: readiness spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: - name: readiness image: busybox args: - /bin/sh - -c - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 60 readinessProbe: exec: command: - cat - /tmp/healthy initialDelaySeconds: 10 periodSeconds: 5 The file is similar to liveness. Just changed the key value. For this one, when it was failure, will restart the pod one time, after that, set the readiness no use.

Health Check practice in the rolling update How the health check used in the rolling update? Image one case, you update the application from V1 to V2, but in fact V2 application is wrong, you didn’t use the checking method to verify this. How will you solve this problem? We can use health check. First, deploy 10 copies with v1. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: app spec: replicas: 10 selector: matchLabels: run: app template: metadata: labels: run: app spec: containers: - name: app image: busybox args: - /bin/sh - -c - sleep 10; touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30000 readinessProbe: exec: command: - cat - /tmp/healthy initialDelaySeconds: 10 periodSeconds: 5 Then rollling update the wrong application. It will trigger the probe to detect. apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: app spec: replicas: 10 selector: matchLabels: run: app template: metadata: labels: run: app spec: containers: - name: app image: busybox args: - /bin/sh - -c - sleep 3000 readinessProbe: exec: command: - cat - /tmp/healthy initialDelaySeconds: 10 periodSeconds: 5 ​ When use this configure file to deploy, will fail. Below is the result. From the result, we can see the new replications can’t pass the health check. But the health check also remain the most old replications. This is because of the maxSurge and maxUnavailable. Will use the default value if not define in the file.maxSurge and maxUnavailable are used to define the rolling update copies and failure copies.

When you want to roll back, you can location this version. Kuebctl apply -f rollback.yaml –record When add the record parameter, will record the reversion.

Scalling a Deployment You can scale a Deployment by using the following command according to your requirements. kubectl scale deployment nginx-deploymnet --replicas=10 Assuming horizontal Pod autoscaling is enabled in your cluster, you can setup an autoscaler for your Deployment and choose the minimum and maximum number of Pods you want to run based on the CPU utilization of your existing Pods. kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deploymnet --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=20 Pausing and Resuming a Deployment You can pause a Deployment before triggering one or more updates and then resume it. This allows you to apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts. kubectl rollout pause deployment nginx-deploymnet This will pause the deployment, then you can patch the changes for this deployment. kubectl set image deployment nginx-deploymnet nginx=nginx:1.16.1 After that, you can resume the the Deployment. kubectl rollout resume deployment nginx-deploymnet Deployment Status The Deployment enters various status during its lifecycle.

The solving method is PV and PVC. PV is maintained by the administration, it’s the extern storage arranged. But PVC is for developer. When deploy the micro service, they can set up the pvc to arrange the space from PV. So PV and PVC coordinate to deploy the whole system. 4.1 NFS PersistentVolume At first, install the NFS service in the master and slave nodes. Also define the mount path. Below are the PV and PVC configure file. nfs-pv.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: mypv1 spec: capacity: storage: 1Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle storageClassName: nfs nfs: path: /tmp/pv1 server: 10.128.0.2 nfs-pvc.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: mypvc1 spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi storageClassName: nfs pod.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: mypod1 spec: containers: - name: mypod1 image: busybox args: - /bin/sh - -c - sleep 30000 volumeMounts: - mountPath: \"/mydata\" name: mydata volumes: - name: mydata persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: mypvc1 In the PV YAML file, we can define the persistent volume policy type. There are 3 types: Retain,Recycle,and Delete.The default policy is Delete. Retain: Users deletes a persistentVolumeClaim.the corresponding persistentVolume is not deleted. Instead, it’s moved to the release phase, where all of its data can be manually recovered. Recycle: It’s different with Retain, the data can’t be manually recovered when delete the PVC. Delete: It’s default mode. Means a dynamically pv is automatically deleted when a user deleted the corresponding pic. When run the pod, will mount the PVC path. Then use command to write something to the mount path. From the below running result, we can understand the PV and PVC in the NFS. About is the static provision, there is another kind of provision, it’s the dynamical provision. It arranges the storage according to the situation. 4.2 Database Practice Background: use NFS PV and PVC to database backup when the node shutdown to verify the data persistence. Steps: Deploy the PV and PVC according to the below configure files. mysql-pvc.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: mysql-pvc spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 1Gi storageClassName: nfs mysql-pv.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: mysql-pv spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce capacity: storage: 1Gi persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain storageClassName: nfs nfs: path: /tmp/mysql-pv server: 10.128.0.2 Deploy the mysql pod and service. piVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: mysql spec: ports: - port: 3306 selector: app: mysql --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: mysql spec: selector: matchLabels: app: mysql template: metadata: labels: app: mysql spec: containers: - image: mysql:5.6 name: mysql env: - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD value: password ports: - containerPort: 3306 name: mysql volumeMounts: - name: mysql-persistent-storage mountPath: /var/lib/mysql volumes: - name: mysql-persistent-storage persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: mysql-pvc Use the client to access the database, insert some messages into the database.

Several ways to upgrade Let’s look at a case first, how to deal with this situation: The POD is currently using the V1 version, and now there is a V2 version, how to replace the V2 version with the V1 version? There are three ways: Delete the old version POD and replace it with the new version POD This method is more violent. It is to directly modify the configuration template of V1 to V2, and then delete the POD of V1. At this time, the template of V2 will be detected. If there is no POD, the POD of V2 version will be restarted. One problem with this approach is that the entire service stops when V1 is deleted. blue-green deployment This is like this, that is, your program supports V1 and V2 versions at the same time, and your environment resources are sufficient to run these two at the same time. How to do it? It is to start the V2 POD in your environment. After everything is ok, you can delete the V1 POD and switch the service traffic to V2. The problem with this method is that the resource overhead is relatively large. rolling upgrade This is more powerful. It uses capacity expansion and contraction to realize dynamic replacement and upgrade. What do you mean, is to define the old and new versions of PODs in your deployment file, and then delete the V1 PODs in turn to dynamically expand the V2 PODs. But in this way, if you use commands to operate, it is more cumbersome.

First, the upgrade needs to be triggered. How to trigger it? It is triggered by modifying the Deployment file. You can use Kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2 to re-specify the image, and the POD will download the image again.

How to play, is to do a rolling upgrade first, and then immediately suspend the rolling upgrade. At this time, a new POD will be created, the old POD is still running, and some traffic will be switched to the new POD, and then test, test After passing, you can resume the rolling upgrade, complete the replacement, and if the test fails, you can roll back to the previous version. The canary upgrade is actually to let some people experience the new version. Take a look at the command: kubectl rollout pause deployment kubia kubectl rollout resume deployment kubia Prevent rolling upgrades of buggy versions There is another better way, which is to set a time period and set the probe. During this time period, if there is no problem with the new POD, rolling upgrade is supported. This is equivalent to setting up an insurance that can minimize the risk.

In fact, you have to understand that environment variables are for containers, so one way of thinking is this. Define environment variables in the container, and the programs in the container reference the environment variables, and then assign values to the environment variables in the POD configuration file. , which is normal operation. Just like this, an environment variable is defined, and then, this variable is assigned in the POD. How about this method, okay? Obviously it is not good. Without decoupling, the environment variables and POD configuration files are strongly related. So is there a good way to achieve decoupling?

This example is to use POD to rewrite the environment variable INTERVAL in the container. The basic process is this: Don’t explain it, it’s clear. But there is a question, what if this configuration file does not exist, can this POD still be up, the answer is no. It will wait until the configuration file exists before the container can start. Of course, you can also set parameters so that it can start POD without a configuration file. Of course, if your config file contains a lot of key-values, it is troublesome to set them one by one, but it can be done in one step. prefix is used to set the prefix, and there is another one.

These processes can share CPU, RAM, network, etc., but each container is With their own file systems, these systems are isolated from each other. Is there a way for these containers to share the file system? You think about this scenario, for example, a container in the POD is hung up, and then a new one is started, but this one still uses the file system resources of the previous one. How to solve this problem, do you have to use volumes, which is equivalent to using shared ones? this file system. Look at this, there are three containers running in one POD, each of which is an independent file system, do you think this can run? Let me introduce these three containers, webserver, which is the entrance of the web, content is used to store web page information, and log is used to store logs.

Introduce two kinds: emptyDir It is also the simplest type of volume, and it is also the basis of other volumes. It is easy to understand that it is an empty volume. Its life cycle is consistent with the life cycle of POD. This is when the POD starts, a blank space is initialized to store the content. This is an example, each image can set the path of the volume, and then the type of the volume can be set on the volume node. This can define whether to use memory or storage media. Git storage volume This volume is also very interesting, it is designed for git warehouse, This is the model diagram. When the POD starts, it will pull the remote git warehouse into this volume, but this cannot be synchronized in real time. I understand that it will not be so advanced. The prototype of the GIT volume is an empty volume, so the life cycle is consistent with that of the POD. ![1568261085518]( HostPath Volume Can files be shared between PODs? Yes, this is the HostPath volume. Look at this picture, two PODs share this HostPath volume, so even if you delete a POD, it will not affect this volume. But there is a problem, this volume is strongly related to POD, that is, if you use other POD, you cannot access this volume. persistent volume This part is compatible with very different environments. If you are using GCP, there are corresponding component support, and other cloud platforms also have other corresponding components. So I won’t talk about this part.

To obtain the yaml or json format file of the running POD, you can use kubectl get po kubia -o yaml or kubectl get po kubia -o json. kubectl port-forward kubela 8888:8080 is used for port mapping.

POD label There is no doubt that the role of labels is to distinguish PODs. So adding tags is to better manage your POD. A POD can set multiple tags, and then use the tags to schedule PODs uniformly.

Understanding Docker images, file systems and containers The image of the container is a file after packaging and compiling the container. The packaging image depends on the Dockerfile file. The From line defines the starting content of the image, which is the basic image for construction. The process of building the image is to upload the entire directory of files to the Docker guardian During the process, Docker will first pull the basic image from the basic image warehouse, and then the packaging of the image is a layered structure, with the basic image as a layer, and then each command will be used as a new layer, layer by layer , the whole is a joint file system. The understanding of the container, the container is actually an instance of the image running. The container runs on the operating system of the host, so there will be a problem, such as an image packaged on the RedHat host, can this image run on ubuntu? Not necessarily, it depends on whether you use something specific to the host, but you are running something that is not available on another host. The container running from the image is equivalent to a process on the host machine. The file system between each container is also independent.

Kubernetes cluster and Mini Kube Let’s first understand the concept of a cluster. What is a cluster? A cluster is a combination of multiple computer nodes to form a cluster, so the advantages of the cluster are also obvious, which can better manage the system and provide the performance of a stand-alone system. Take a look at mini kube, it is a local single-node cluster, it is not suitable for multi-node situations. To interact with kubernetes, you also need the kubernetes cli client. Overview of multi-node Kubernetes clusters: A kubernetes diagram of three nodes. Take a look at this thing, each working node has Docker, Kubelet and Kube-proxy, and you can use kubectl to send control commands to the master node through rest to control each sub-node. interesting.

ReplicationController POD is the smallest unit controlled by Kubernetes. Kubernetes does not care about container scheduling, it only manages POD. There can be many containers in a POD, but this group of containers is closely related because they can be regarded as running on the same host. So what is ReplicationControler, and what is it used for. According to my understanding, ReplicationControler is used to manage the horizontal expansion of POD, which can ensure that the specified number of POD can operate normally according to the setting. You can look at this picture, after external access, it will only be mapped to an internal ip, and then we don’t care which POD is called, because each POD inside is an independent ip.

To modify a module, the whole package needs to be deployed.

DevOps Microservices brought about DevOps. The previous team combination was that after the developers completed the development, they gave the results to the operation and maintenance, and then the operation and maintenance completed the deployment, and the development and operation and maintenance were completely separated.

Developers cannot understand the needs of users at the first time, and they do not understand the operating environment of the system, and the operation and maintenance do not understand the functions of the product.
