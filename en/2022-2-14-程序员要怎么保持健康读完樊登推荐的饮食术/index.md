# How can programmers stay healthy? After reading 《饮食术》 recommended by Fan Deng, I understand


# Cutting Edge

I have always been interested in the issue of eating, but now there are too many fake science popularizations on the Internet. Sometimes it is said to control the intake of carbohydrates and lipids every day, and it is said that it is enough to eat normally, which once made it difficult for me to choose. I accidentally listened to Fan Deng reading and explaining the book "Diet Technique", and I trusted Teacher Fan Deng more. I believed that it should be an authoritative science popularization of conscience, so I read this book seriously. I really don’t know if I don’t read it. I was shocked when I read it. It overturned my previous cognition of diet. Many opinions in it are extremely bold. Both points are correct.

As a programmer who lacks exercise every day, physical health is really important. As we grow older, various physical problems are more or less exposed, such as fatty liver, bulging belly, Obesity and more. And many times we don't pay much attention to diet, and it's not that we don't pay attention to it. The main reason is that we don't know anything about scientific eating habits, so we usually eat whatever we catch. This article is also after I read this book, I will refine some knowledge points in it, so that friends who don't have time to read the whole book can quickly grasp the knowledge points in the book.

I haven't listed all 16 lies. Some of them are related to Japanese eating habits. We have no reference value here, so ignore them.

Like most people may think that low fat is good, our body gets fat because we eat too much fat; and a balanced diet feels that we can control our body; weight loss will reduce muscle mass, etc. These can be said to be fake news, later you will learn what makes us fat, losing weight does not make muscles less and so on.

# Optimum intake of the three major nutrients

The three major nutrients are: carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.

- **Sugar is a source of energy**
- **Lipids are the components that make up cell membranes**
- **Protein is an essential component of muscle and bone**

<br>

For the ingestion of these three, and the possible consequences of each ingestion, you can see the figure below.

Looking at this picture can be extracted: **Be sure to reduce carbohydrate intake, and the settings can be replaced by lipids and proteins. For lipids, you should eat good lipids, eat more unsaturated fatty acid foods, and use less saturated fatty acid foods as much as possible. **

# Eat various ingredients

- **Comprehensive diet, eating meat, whether it is fat or bone marrow, not even the genitals are left, all eaten. **
- **The more natural the better, ultra-processed food can induce cancer**

This picture lists some of the foods that should be used frequently and can replace carbohydrates.

Fish and other meat should be taken alternately, and the intake of chicken should be more, the amount of pork should be moderate, and beef should be used occasionally.

# Epilogue

I just summarized some key points in the book. There is still a lot of theoretical knowledge in the book. Interested students can study it slowly. I believe it will definitely help you.

One last sentence: **If you want to live a healthy life, you must first start by admitting that you know nothing. Admit that what you have done before may be wrong, only then will you be able to accept new knowledge and new concepts**.
